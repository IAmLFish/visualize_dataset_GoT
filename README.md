# visualize_dataset_GoT
## Contribution for "How to Best Visualize a Dataset Easily" Siraj Raval on YouTube
# Observations:
Currently none that I can mention and reason well.

## What you can use:
* `analysis.ipynb`: Contains some exploratory analysis and easy interaction
  * Plotting with different labels
  * Filtering the mappedTSNE-data with `filterLabel` and `filterValue`
  * Adding more battle or character features
* `data_visualization.py`: A nearly copy of `analysis.ipynb` (I mainly work on the jupyter notebook file)

## What you should NOT expect:
Perfectly written and reusable code. 
I wrote this to have some kind of state to be able to do the above.
